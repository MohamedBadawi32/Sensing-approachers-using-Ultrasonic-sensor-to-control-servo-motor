# Sensing approachers using Ultrasonic sensor to control Servo motors
In this project, Servo motors were controlled by ultrasonic sensor through two different Arduino to retate 6 Servo motors if an object stood in front of the sensor for 3 seconds or more in 75 cm region.

## Components and connection description
The project was constructed using two Arduinos Uno that are connected together by transmitter, receiver, and ground pins, 6 Servo motors their signal pins are connected to digital pins of the slave Arduino, and an ultrasonic sensor that is connected to the master Arduino. 

## Working principle 
Basically, if an object approached the ultrasonic
